# GraphQL with Apollo

This project demostrate the BFF talking to three different data source. This is one of the goal of GraphQL that it makes the backend for frontend. This leaves the frontend simple and easy.

## Apollo

- Apollo Client: A GraphQL client for every frontend platform.
- Apollo Server: A library for writing GraphQL servers with JavaScript.
- Apollo Engine: A GraphQL gateway that provides caching, error tracking, and performance tracing.

## Schema

At the core of any GraphQL server is a schema. The schema defines types and their relationships. It also specifies which queries can be made against the server.

GraphQL APIs are extremely flexible because you can layer them on top of any service, including any business logic, REST APIs, databases, or gRPC services.
